# Nathan's SQL Snippets

A collection of custom T-SQL Snippets for use with Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS).

## Installation

Clone this repo into a local folder. Then open **Tools** > **Code Snippets Manager** in SSMS and click **Add** to add this folder. Alternatively, click **Import** to selectively import only the snippets you need.

## Usage

The easiest way to add a snippet is to right-click in your SSMS query editor window and select **Insert Snippet**. Most snippets have placeholders, such as table or column names, that SSMS will highlight after inserting the snippet. Double-click each placeholder and type its value to populate the query.

*Carefully review any query built with a snippet before running it!*
